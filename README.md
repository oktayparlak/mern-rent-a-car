# MERN-Rent-A-Car Project

This project is a car rental website application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Users can search for cars, make reservations, and complete payments.

__The server part is currently under development. Later, the client part will be developed.__

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts: the client and the server.

- **client**: Contains the client-side application developed using React. It creates the user interface and handles user interactions.

- **server**: Contains the server-side application built using Express.js. It provides REST APIs, performs database operations, and responds to requests made by the client.
