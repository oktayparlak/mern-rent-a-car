# MERN-Rent-A-Car Project

This project is a car rental website application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Users can search for cars, make reservations, and complete payments.

- **client**: Contains the client-side application developed using React. It creates the user interface and handles user interactions.
